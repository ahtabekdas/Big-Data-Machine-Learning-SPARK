In this data analytics project, we aim to predict customer churn using a dataset containing relevant features such as 'Age,' 'Total_Purchase,' 'Account_Manager,' 'Years,' 'Num_Sites,' and the target variable 'Churn.' Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop using the services or products of a company.
